# AthleticBoy
AthleticBoy is a game based on Athletic Land for the MSX (https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_Land). 
The goal of the game is to walk from the left tree to the right tree in 20 stages without getting hit or drowning in one of the many ponds. 
To do this, you can walk, jump and bend over. All of this has to be done in a limited amount of time. You have 5 lives when you start. If you don't make it to the other side, a life will be lost. If you make it, you get a life back (maximum 5). 

Good luck.
